## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

### 4. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into **easy**, **medium**, and **advanced** levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

#### Easy Queries
- Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
  
#### Medium Queries
- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
  
#### Advanced Queries
- Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization.

#### Business Requirements Analysis

## Easy Level Insights

Tracks with Over 1 Billion Streams
Query: SELECT * FROM spotifytable WHERE Stream > 1000000000
Insight: Identifies blockbuster tracks with massive popularity. These tracks are likely global hits, and their artists or genres could guide marketing campaigns or playlist curation.


Albums and Artists
Query: SELECT DISTINCT Album, Artist FROM spotifytable ORDER BY 1
Insight: Provides a catalog of albums linked to artists, useful for organizing discographies or identifying collaborations. Duplicate artists across albums may indicate prolific creators.


Comments for Licensed Tracks
Query: SELECT * FROM spotifytable WHERE Licensed = 'TRUE'
Insight: Licensed tracks may have higher engagement (comments), reflecting official releases. Summing comments for these tracks can quantify fan interaction.


Single Tracks
Query: SELECT Track FROM spotifytable WHERE Album_type = 'single'
Insight: Singles are often promotional releases. Identifying these tracks helps focus on trending or new content for playlists or radio.


Tracks per Artist
Query: SELECT Artist, COUNT(*) AS total_no_songs FROM spotifytable GROUP BY Artist
Insight: Artists with high track counts are prolific, potentially indicating established careers or high output. This can inform artist partnerships or fan targeting.
